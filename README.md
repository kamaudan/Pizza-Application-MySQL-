# Pizza-World

This application is a different version of the application "Pizza Application", The one before I was using the reactive extension to make it asynchronous non-blocking.

This application is synchronous and non-blocking in nature, it is an example of what not to do when you are writting your application.

It uses: Tomcat server(Blocking), MySQL database(blocking), Spring data JPA and Hibernate(Blocking).

It is for comparison purpose with the application in the 'Pizza Application' repo.
